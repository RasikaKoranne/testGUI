            <p>Traditionally, data warehouses take too long to build and are too hard to change. <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  is an Integrated Development Environment, designed to support the quick and simple building and managing of data warehouses.</p>
            <p>It has the flexibility to enable you to build a variety of architectures including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>enterprise data warehouses</li>
                <li>dimensional data warehouses</li>
                <li>data marts</li>
                <li>user facing views, aggregates and summaries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In all cases, the core values of <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  are twofold: its rapid building capabilities that enable better data warehouses to be built, faster, and its integrated environment that simplifies management. </p>
            <p>As a data warehouse specific tool, <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  embodies a simple, pragmatic approach to building data warehouses. With <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  you specify what you want to achieve by dragging and dropping objects to create a meta view, and then let <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  do the heavy lifting of creating the necessary tables, procedures, documentation, etc. Data warehouse wizards prompt for additional information at critical points to provide the maximum value from the generated objects.</p>
            <p>Different data warehousing approaches including agile, prototyping and waterfall are supported by <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>. Agile developers will find specific functionality has been included to support common agile practices. For developers who are new to data warehousing, or are looking for a fast, pragmatic approach, <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span>'s Pragmatic Data Warehousing Methodology can be used.</p>
            <p>The basic concepts behind <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> 's Pragmatic Data Warehousing Methodology are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>minimize the impact on the source systems</li>
                <li>centralize management within the data warehouse</li>
                <li>store transactional data at the lowest practical grain within the data warehouse</li>
                <li>snapshot, combine and rollup transactional tables to provide additional value</li>
                <li>utilize star schemas, views or cubes for end user access</li>
                <li>allow for incremental loads from day one</li>
                <li>use of an iterative approach</li>
                <li>simplifying the reconciliation of Load tables to source system tables - data is cleaned and transformed in subsequent Stage tables instead</li>
                <li>design the data warehouse independently from the end user tool layer</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  supports these concepts to facilitate very rapid delivery of data warehouses. <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  controls the flow of data from the source systems through transforming and modeling layers to analysis areas. </p>
            <p>Different styles of data warehousing (e.g. EDW 3NF, dimensional, etc.) are supported and utilize different objects, but all follow the same basic flow.</p>
            <h3>Data Flow - Enterprise Models </h3>
            <ol>
                <li value="1">Source (OLTP) System</li>
                <li value="2">load tables</li>
                <li value="3">stage tables</li>

            <p data-mc-conditions="Outputs.Exclude_External_OLH">

            </p>
            <h3>Data Flow</h3>
            <p>Data is moved from source tables to Load tables via scripts, database links and ODBC links. These Load tables are created by dragging and dropping from a connection object. Load tables are generally based on source system tables. Their main purpose is to be a destination for moving data as simply and quickly as possible from the source system. Load tables generally hold a single unit of data (e.g. last night or last month), and truncated at the start of each extract. Transformations can be performed on the columns during the load process, if required. </p>
            <p>Load tables feed Stage tables, which in turn feed Data Store, Model or Dimension tables. Data from multiple Load tables can be combined at this level. </p>
            <p>First tier transactional tables (Fact or Model) are created and updated from Stage tables. Second tier tables (Model, Summary Rollup, Aggregate, KPI, etc.) are created and updated from lower level tables. </p>
            <p>Cubes can be created from transactional tables or views.</p>
            <h3>Procedural code</h3>
            <p><span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  generates procedural code in the target database's native language (e.g. PL/SQL for Oracle) at each stage in the data warehouse build process. The generated code is, in nearly all cases, sufficient to create a rapid prototype of the data warehouse.</p>
            <p>While the generation of code is often seen as a key benefit of <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>, the ability to control and manage custom code is also critical to the long term management of the data warehouse environment.</p>
            <p>In most cases 85-100% of the generated code is taken through to production with no customization required.</p>
            <h3>Scheduler</h3>
            <p>The flow of data from the source systems to data warehouse tables is controlled and managed by the <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  Scheduler. All generated code includes audit and error logging logic that is used by the Scheduler.</p>
            <p>The Scheduler provides a single point of control for the data warehouse. From the Scheduler, the state of all jobs can be ascertained. Any warning or error messages can be investigated and if a problem occurs, the Scheduler controls the restart of the job from the point of failure.</p>
            <h3>Documentation</h3>
            <p>Documenting the data warehouse is often a task left until last, and in many cases done once (if done at all!) and not kept up to date. <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  generates user and technical documentation, including diagrams in HTML format.</p>
            <p>Technical documentation includes copies of all current procedures.</p>
            <p>User documentation includes a glossary of business terms, available independently of any end user tool.</p>
            <p>Where additional specific information needs to be included in the documentation, <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  supports the inclusion of custom HTML pages in the generated output. This means in many cases the entire documentation requirements can be managed from one location, and regenerated as changes occur.</p>
            <h3><span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span> and Traditional ETL Tools</h3>
            <p><span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span> 's core strength is in the rapid building of data warehouse structures. Organizations that have already purchased traditional ETL tools can use <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  as a pureplay data warehouse toolset. <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  can be used to iteratively build data marts or presentation layer objects that need to be constantly updated to keep relevant for end users. In most cases, customers will find that <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  has enough ETL capabilities to build the entire data warehouse, using the database rather than a proprietary engine to perform ETL processing.</p>
            <p>The cross over in functionality between ETL tools and <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  is not large. <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  is tightly integrated into the data warehouse database and has an embedded data warehouse building approach. For <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span>, data movement is the start of the process—from source system to Load tables. The key benefits of the product: development productivity and an integrated environment to manage and maintain your data warehouse, comes after the data movement stage. </p>
            <p>Where a traditional ETL tool is already in use, the output of the ETL process is a <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  Load, Stage, Dimension, Fact or Model table from which <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.CompanyShortName variable">WhereScape</span> <span class="mc-variable WS_Branding.Product variable">RED</span>  builds more advanced data warehouse structures.</p>
