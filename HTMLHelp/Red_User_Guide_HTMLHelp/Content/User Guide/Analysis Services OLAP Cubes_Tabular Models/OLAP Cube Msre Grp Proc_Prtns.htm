                        The processing or updating method of a Measure Group is an area that requires careful consideration. The default option is <b>Full process</b> which results in the Measure Group being rebuilt. This is in many ways the safest option, but processing time may mean other options must be chosen. 
                        <p class="BodyText">The following describes the processing methods that are available in Analysis Services for Measure Groups: </p><ul><li><b>Default Process</b> - Detects the process state of the measure group, and performs processing necessary to deliver a fully processed state.</li><li><b>Full Process</b> - Processes an Analysis Services Measure Group regardless of state. When Process Full is executed against a Measure Group that has already been processed, Analysis Services drops all data, and then processes it.</li><li><b>Incremental Process</b> - Adds newly available fact data and process only to the relevant partitions.  To use this option you must set the 'incremental filter' field with a statement that results in only new data being selected. Failure to do so , results in duplicated data in the cube. <br />In many data warehouses a fact table undergoes changes to the data, as well as the addition of new data, and so the incremental update option is not possible. A validation regime must be put in place to compare cube data to the fact data if incremental is used. This validation regime must be used to notify the administrator in the event that duplicate data is inserted into the cube.</li><li><b>Update Data</b> - Processes data only without building aggregations or indexes. If there is data in the partitions, it is be dropped before re-populating the partition with source data. This processing option is supported for dimensions, cubes, measure groups, and partitions.</li><li><b>Build Structure</b> - If the cube is unprocessed, Analysis Services processes, if it is necessary, all the cube's dimensions. After that, Analysis Services creates only cube definitions. The build structure option just builds the cube structure without populating it. This can be useful if you have a very large cube and want to validate the design.</li></ul></td>

As mentioned above, caution must be taken when using incremental updates. For example, if the Measure Group is accidentally processed twice and the filter is based on date, then duplicate data is inserted into the Measure Group without any warning.</td>

When dealing with a large fact table, such a query may take a long time to complete. <br />This field can be used to include the components of the 'Where' clause to restrict the amount of data examined. For example, we may enter 'dss_update_time &lt; GETDATE()-14' to only look at fact table records that have been inserted or updated in the last 14 days. This still enables you to catch any new partitions and add them. <br />The first time a cube is converted to auto partitioning handling, a full pass of the Fact table should occur to allow inclusion of every partition. This field must therefore only be populated once the cube has been initially built with all partitions intact.</td>
